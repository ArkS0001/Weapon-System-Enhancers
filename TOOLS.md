### Open-Source Software and Libraries
These are freely available on platforms like GitHub, making them ideal for custom builds or algorithm experimentation in Python or JS.

- **propNav**: A Python-based 3-DOF (degrees of freedom) point mass kinematic model for proportional navigation guidance in missiles. It simulates trajectories and generates files for 3D visualization, with capabilities for ideal missile behavior against targets. Great for testing PN algorithms you mentioned last time—written entirely in Python 3 for easy extension.[1]
- **AirSim (Microsoft)**: An open-source simulator for drones, cars, and autonomous vehicles, built on Unreal Engine (with experimental Unity support). It supports hardware-in-the-loop and software-in-the-loop testing, including realistic physics for UAV defense scenarios like swarm attacks or missile evasion. Use it to prototype AI-driven defenses with reinforcement learning APIs.[2]
- **UavNetSim-v1**: A Python-based platform for simulating UAV communication networks, including rapid prototyping of protocols like routing and topology control. It's modular for beginners but extensible for advanced users, with visual analysis tools—perfect for modeling drone swarms in defense contexts.[3]
- **MRS UAV Platform**: An open-source research system for multirotor UAVs, including realistic simulations of sensors, localization, and autonomous behaviors. It supports GNSS-denied environments and multi-frame estimation, useful for anti-UAV defense sims. Well-documented on GitHub with hardware integration options.[4]
- **PX4 Autopilot**: Open-source flight control software for drones and UAVs, with flexible tools for developers. It includes simulation capabilities for testing autonomous navigation and defense tactics, like countering incoming threats.[5]
- **NASA Open Source Software (MFS)**: A pluggable framework for multi-fidelity air traffic flow simulation, which can extend to missile or UAV trajectories in airspace defense models. It's designed for varying levels of detail in scenarios.[6]

### Government and Defense-Specific Tools
These are often free or restricted to certain users (e.g., US agencies) and focus on high-fidelity missile defense simulations.

- **EADSIM (Extended Air Defense Simulation)**: A government-owned tool for many-on-many simulations of air, missile, and space warfare. It supports operational planning, integrated air/missile defense analysis, and training, with features like improved sensor modeling in its latest version (20.5). Free for US government agencies and contractors; runs on Windows/Linux.[7]
- **Integrated Weapon System Simulation (DRDO)**: Developed by India's DRDO, this includes packages like Vyuha and Chakra Vyuha for simulating surface-to-air missile systems. It handles performance prediction, algorithm evaluation, Monte Carlo simulations, and countermeasures—aligns well with your interest in India's SMART system.[8]
- **Air Defence Simulation and Evaluation System (ADSES)**: From BEL India, this platform simulates weapon systems with ground/aerial entities, scenario creation, and 3D visualization for attack/defense battles. Useful for evaluating battlefield elements like sensors and targets.[9]

### Commercial Simulation Software
These are paid or licensed tools, often used in professional defense engineering, with robust features for complex modeling.

- **AnyLogic**: A multimethod simulation software for defense applications, including military logistics, threat analysis, and optimization. It provides virtual environments for testing processes like missile defense strategies.[10]
- **vsTASKER**: A complete toolkit for defense simulations, supporting scenario animation, visualization, and C++ code generation. It's used for UAV path optimization, electronic warfare, and anti-missile systems, with Monte Carlo capabilities for large-scale runs.[11]
- **STK Missile Tool Kit (AGI)**: Part of Systems Tool Kit for digital mission engineering, it models defense systems like radars and sensors for detecting/tracking ballistic threats. Includes radar performance analysis and reports for threat evaluation.[12]
- **Ansys Simulation Solutions**: Comprehensive tools for accelerating defense tech development, including hypersonics and missile systems. It enables rapid testing and deployment of next-gen technologies.[13]

### Python-Focused Libraries for Custom Builds
Since you're Python-savvy (from your string manipulation and algorithm projects), these can integrate into your own sim:

- **AsaPy**: A Python library for aerospace simulation analysis, with models for sensors (radar, sonar, missile warning) and weapons. It's equipped for defense scenarios and performance evaluation.[14]
- **Custom 6-DOF Simulations**: Libraries like those inspired by research papers offer building blocks for missile guidance/control, using object-oriented patterns for modular sims (e.g., in C++ or Java, but portable to Python).[15][16]

If you're building from scratch, start with propNav or UavNetSim-v1 for quick prototypes—they're lightweight and align with your AI framework explorations (e.g., adding LangChain for smart agent behaviors). For a full setup, combine AirSim with PX4 for UAV defense testing. I didn't find many purely open-source missile-specific tools (as noted in community discussions), but these cover a lot of ground.[17]

What's your focus—Python libraries for algo dev, or something more visual like AirSim? If you need help integrating one into a web app or code snippets, let me know!

Hey Aakarshit! Building on our ongoing project with missile guidance sims and tools like airdefense.dev, I've expanded the search for RocketPy-like software—focusing on Python libraries and open-source simulators for rockets, missiles, and related aerospace/defense scenarios. RocketPy stands out as a robust 6-DOF Python library for high-power rocket trajectories, including weather integration and parachute descent.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]

I've compiled a complete table below, drawing from this and prior searches. It includes open-source options (prioritizing Python where possible) with key details like type, description, and links. These are great for prototyping algorithms or integrating into your custom sim—e.g., combining RocketPy's physics with propNav's guidance models.
