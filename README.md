# Weapon-System-Enhancers

# 1. Guidance & Control Systems

Autopilot algorithms for stable missile/aircraft flight.

Advanced control laws: PID → LQR → MPC (Model Predictive Control).

Sensor fusion: combining IMU, GPS, radar, IR seekers.

AI/ML-based trajectory prediction for target interception.

# 2. Navigation Systems

Robust INS/GPS integration.

Work on anti-jamming navigation.

Visual navigation (terrain matching, SLAM-like for aerial systems).

# 3. Flight Dynamics & Simulation

High-fidelity 6-DOF missile/aircraft flight simulations.

CFD + flight dynamics coupling for trajectory refinement.

Autonomous maneuvering (loiter, evasive path planning).

# 4. Propulsion & Aerodynamics (Software side)

Propulsion performance modeling.

Aerodynamic stability simulations under different Mach regimes.

Multiphysics simulation pipelines.

# 5. Mission Planning Systems

Trajectory optimization (shortest time to target, minimum radar exposure).

Cooperative swarms (multi-missile/ drone coordination).

AI-based re-tasking mid-flight.
